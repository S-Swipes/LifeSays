## 🎮 About the Game

**LifeSays** is a rhythm-based memory game that puts a musical twist on the classic Simon Says formula. Players must carefully observe and repeat sequences of musical interactions with charming animated characters, each with their own unique sounds and personalities.

The game embraces the jam theme "Loop" through its core gameplay mechanic: players watch musical sequences play out, then must repeat them back perfectly. Each successful round adds complexity, creating an ever-growing loop of musical memory challenges.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**LifeSays** explores the concept of "Loop" through multiple layers:

1. **Gameplay Loop**: Watch → Remember → Repeat → Progress
2. **Musical Loops**: Recurring musical patterns that build complexity
3. **Visual Loops**: Character animations that cycle and repeat
4. **Learning Loop**: Players improve through repetition and muscle memory

The game celebrates the beauty found in repetition, showing how simple musical loops can create engaging, challenging, and meditative gameplay experiences.
